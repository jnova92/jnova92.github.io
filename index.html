					<h2 style="color:#ffdf00; font-size: 2rem; text-align: center;">About me</h2>
					<p>Hello! I'm an expert in applied statistics, psychometrics, behavior research methodology,
						and self-taught in machine learning. My background in psychology and psychometrics give me an advantage when analyzing and interpreting data related to human behavior.
						Moreover, I am fully comfortable with data from other domains. I have approximately 5 years of experience with data analysis, and I'm not far 
						from obtaining a Ph.D. in psychometrics. As a person, I am a continually improving knowledge junkie that likes to read whenever 
						possible. I love both large-scale projects and minor assignments, especially those that require integrating abstract concepts in order to achieve a simple solution with concrete implications.</p>

									<h4 class="perks-heading">Creative outlook on data</h4>
									<p>Domain expertise in psychometrics and psychology assists me in reasoning about findings, being aware of cognitive biases, 
									and communicating insights to diverse types of audience from basic to advanced level. Over time, I have acquired keen divergent and lateral thinking skills, which aid with creating new variables, 
									asking questions, and deciding how to solve the problem and obtain insights. At the same time, my thinking can be analytical and logical, so I adjust the approach 
									based on the task at hand. My problem solving skills evolved due to practical experience with data, scientific experience, and playing chess in free time. </p>

									<h4 class="perks-heading">Systematic problem-solver</h4>
									<p>I love solving problems of mathematical and/or psychological nature. Discovering solutions to complex problems and presenting them in a 
									straightforward way give me buzz. Over time, I have become foolproof to frustration and discouragement. I enjoy devoting days, even weeks, working on a particular problem and learning. As a result, I have 
									gained technical skills, such as statistical programming, machine learning, and RDBMS. I primarily use R, though I am familiar with other
									software (e.g., SPSS, Tableau, Orange) and I like learning new technology (for instance, I built this website myself based on a free template and am currently learning Python).

						<p class="caption wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1000ms">This project uses the dataset about 10,000 customers of a particular bank with branches in France, Germany, and Spain. 
							I created new variables, conducted EDA, and selected predictors of customer churn using random forest algorithm. Then I used blending ensemble of random forest, C5.0 tree, 
							boosted binary logistic regression, support vector machine with Gaussian radial basis kernel function, and k-nearest neighbours for the binary classification. 
							Useful predictive models were obtained for two groups that differ in terms of customer churn. The model for the group with a problematic customer churn is more accurate than the other one.

						<p class="caption wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="750ms">This project uses a dataset with multiple tables about American car models production from 1896 to 2014.
							I conducted EDA, and used hierarchical multiple zero-inflated negative binomial regression to examine the predictors of
							the number of years a car model is in production. Car manufacturers were segmented based on car model production patterns using k-medoids cluster analysis. After that, historical time series analysis
							with Poisson model was used to check how economic conditions influence car model production for each segment. Some useful insights about economic conditions, car model competition, and car manufacturer segments were obtained.

							contest organized by Analytics Vidhya. In this project, association rules on demographics and purchasing behavior were used instead of predictive modeling. After the EDA,
							I discretized a few variables using k-means clustering and applied apriori algorithm to discover the rules with highly above regular and extreme amounts of purchases for 
							each product category on the right-hand side. Useful rules with high confidence and lift that are applicable for a marketing campaign were found.

						<p class="caption wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="750ms">This project uses the dataset on 9,841 known fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions provided by Ethereum. I conducted
							EDA and created many new variables. There were two applicable observations about fraudulent transactions. It was first discovered that data missingness pattern can be a useful first step for detecting fraudulent transactions. In the 
							following analysis with non-missing data, I used random forest algorithm for predictor selection. Then I used a blending ensemble of random forest and C5.0 tree for the binary classification problem. 
							A model that predicts fraudulent transactions with nearly perfect balanced accuracy, .93 kappa, and .99 ROC was found.

							1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR about 2,215 communities. I checked if a useful predictive model of particular criminal behaviors can be found. I selected predictors using lasso regression. A blending ensemble of 
							random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and partial least squares (PLS) regression was used for the regression problem. It was discovered that the number of assaults per population and the number of burglaries per population can be 
							accurately predicted based on some other criminal behaviors and demographic variables.

							that were made over a period of approximately one year. I conducted EDA and created some new variables. Then I combined exploratory factor analysis, divisive hierarchical cluster analysis, 
							and fuzzy c-means cluster analysis to segment the customers based on transaction behavior. Some insights on most profitable products, customers, areas, periods, as well as cancellations were obtained.
							It was found which customers should be made a priority to retain, and where could the marketing campaign be focused and expanded in terms of geographical areas and customer segments.

						<p class="caption wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="750ms">This project uses Lahman's dataset on baseball that covers the period from 1871 to 2020.
							I joined several tables to examine player entrance in the Hall of Fame based on player performance, place of origin, and voter groups that make decison about entrance into Hall of Fame. 
							EDA was conducted and some new variables were created. There was a rare case in which random forest algorithm was used for explanatory analysis. Moreover, exploratory factor analysis combined
							with hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis and visualization were used to answer the questions. There were interesting insights about importance of aspects of player performance for the entrance
							into the Hall of Fame, cities that produce players, and representation of voter groups over time.

						<p class="caption wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="750ms">This project uses RAWG Video Games database that consists of variables related to 474,417 video games. 
							After EDA, games were clustered based on their features using HDBSCAN algorithm and based on RAWG user behavior using k-means clustering. Flexible discriminant analysis with polynomial and ridge 
							regression, respectively, was used to get additional insights on cluster separation. Correspondence analysis was used to check the relationship between the two clusterings. Finally, combinations
							of two clusterings were explored in terms of average game rating. Some findings are unsurprising, while some are potentially useful, such as which features popular video games typically have.

						<p class="caption wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="750ms">This project is based on a synthetic dataset about 311 employees, so the results are not generalizable to any
							real conditions. However, the insights would be useful for the fictitious company - if it were real. I was able to heavily rely on domain expertise in psychology
							for this analysis. Poisson regression and multilevel binary logistic regression were used to obtain insights that explain some processes behind 
							employee absence and churn. This is an example of situations in which negative findings are also informative for insights about organizational processes and potential improvement within the 
							organization as a whole and within particular departments. There were also suggestions what else could be done if such findings were found in a real setting.

							I conducted multigroup confirmatory factor analysis based on participant age and further confirmed the five factor structure roughly 
							holds in different cultures regardless of the age with a borderline good fit. Measurement invariance in terms of intercept and residuals holds across the explored age brackets,
							but there are minor differences in factor loadings. Only one out of 50 items had intra-class correlation above .05, so multilevel factor analysis was not applicable.
