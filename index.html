					<h2 style="color:#ffdf00; font-size: 2rem; text-align: center;">About me</h2>
					<p>Hello! I'm a data scientist specializing in applied statistics, psychometrics, and behavioral research methodology. My background in psychology and psychometrics provides a unique advantage in analyzing and interpreting data related to human behavior.
						I have over 10 years of overall experience in data analysis, with over 5 years dedicated to measurement and advanced statistical techniques. Additionally, I possess a strong proficiency in machine learning algorithms, allowing me to effectively tackle complex data problems.
						I'm also nearing the completion of my Ph.D. in psychometrics. As a person, I think outside the box and am a continuous learner, always seeking to expand my knowledge. 
						I love reading whenever possible and thrive on both large-scale projects and minor assignments. I especially enjoy tasks that require integrating abstract concepts to achieve simple, yet impactful solutions.
					    My personal favorites are projects that involve advanced statistical techniques, clustering, predictive modeling, or forecasting.</p>

									<h4 class="perks-heading">Creative Outlook on Data</h4>
									<p>Domain expertise in psychometrics and psychology assists me in reasoning about findings, being aware of cognitive biases, 
									and communicating insights to diverse audiences, ranging from basic to advanced levels of understanding. Over time, I have acquired keen divergent and lateral thinking skills, which aid with creating new variables, 
									asking questions, and deciding how to solve the problem and obtain insights. At the same time, my thinking can be analytical and logical, so I adjust the approach 
									based on the task at hand. My problem-solving abilities have been further sharpened through practical experience with data analysis, scientific research, and even in leisure activities like playing chess.</p>

									<h4 class="perks-heading">Systematic Problem-solver</h4>
									<p>I love solving problems of mathematical and/or psychological nature. Discovering solutions to complex problems and presenting them in a 
									straightforward way give me buzz. Over time, I have become foolproof to frustration and discouragement. I enjoy devoting days, even weeks, working on a particular problem and learning. As a result, I have 
									gained technical skills, such as statistical programming, machine learning, and RDBMS. My primary tool is R, though I am able to work in Python when required. 
									Additionally, I'm familiar with various software packages such as SPSS, Tableau, and Orange, and I actively seek opportunities to expand my technological toolkit. For instance, I built this website myself.</p>

							predictors of customer churn using random forest algorithm. To address the class imbalance in the outcome variable, I employed a combination of undersampling and oversampling, using the ROSE algorithm. Then I trained 
							a blending ensemble comprising random forest, C5.0 tree, and support vector machine with Gaussian radial basis kernel function for binary classification. To expedite computation, I parallelized the procedure. 
							The ensemble performed excellently in churn prediction, as indicated by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC in excess of .95 on test dataset.

							the number of years a car model is in production. Car manufacturers were segmented based on car model production policies in terms of car model life span using k-medoids cluster analysis. After that, historical time series analysis
							with Poisson model was used to check how economic conditions influence car model production for each segment. Some useful insights about economic conditions, car model competition, and car manufacturer segments were obtained.

							I discretized numeric variables using k-means clustering to make the discretization objective. Afterward, apriori algorithm was used to discover the rules with above 
							regular amounts of purchases for each product category on the right-hand side. Useful rules with high confidence and lift that are applicable for a marketing campaign were found and
							visualized using a network plot.

							variables and single imputation using the random forest algorithm, principal component analysis was used for dimension reduction before the cluster analysis. Afteraward, I employed hierarchical DBCAN algorithm to 
							cluster the communities based on crime-related variables and found six meaningful clusters in terms of crime rate profiles, which can be useful for policymakers, law enforcement, and urban planners 
							to tailor interventions to specific community crime profiles.

							Afterward, divisive hierarchical cluster analysis and fuzzy c-means cluster analysis were employed to segment customers based on transaction behavior. The discovered segments were described in terms of transaction behavior metrics, 
							such as total spending, average spending per transaction, and the quantity of products purchased, which can be used for marketing purposes.

							for insights about organizational processes and potential improvement within the organization as a whole and within particular departments. Recommendations were provided on further actions that could be taken

							was achieved for English as a native language up to the strict invariance level and for handedness up to the metric invariance level, suggesting that IPIP-50 items can be used confidently across different language and handedness groups, while acknowledging 
							that full invariance across the groups was not achieved.
